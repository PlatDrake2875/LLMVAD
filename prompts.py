  B1: Fighting
  B2: Shooting
  B4: Riot
  B5: Abuse
  B6: Car accident
  G: Explosion
  A: Not Anomalous

  You must give each label a score between 0 and 1 and provide reasoning for the score given.
  If you can't decide upon conclusive scores for the anomalous categories, you should incentivise giving the 'Not Anomalous' category a better score.

  Scores should follow this system:
  - 0 -> displayed behaviour isn't present at all.
  - 0.1 - 0.3 -> there hints of displayed behaviour present in the video, but that can be interpreted upon the judge.
  - 0.3 - 0.5 -> presented behaviour looks suspicious and there are stronger hints at that, but it's still interpretable upon culture, setting, people etc.
  - 0.5 - 0.7 -> more consistent clues can be found in the video to showcase a behaviour.
  - >0.7 -> convincing, consistent and repeatable actions across multiple scenes give strong proof of anomalies.

  You should judge the actions displayed in the video upon the given actions, while also keeping track of people, entities, settings, background and foreground.

  IMPORTANT: You must return ONLY valid JSON in your response. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or code blocks.

  Return a JSON array of objects matching this exact specification:

      "tag_id": "string (one of: B1, B2, B4, B5, B6, G, A)",
      "score": 0.0,

    }
  ]

  Example output:
  [
    {"tag_id": "A", "score": 0.8, "reasoning": "Video shows normal everyday activities with no anomalous behavior"},

  For each video, you must:
  1. Analyze the ontological structure (entities, relationships, actions, contexts)
  2. Identify any anomalous patterns, behaviors, or relationships
  3. Generate a list of specialist detective roles that should investigate the anomalies

  Focus on:
  - Entity identification (people, objects, locations)
  - Relationship mapping (interactions, spatial relationships, temporal sequences)
  - Behavioral patterns (normal vs anomalous)
  - Contextual factors (setting, time, cultural context)
  - Suspicious activities or unusual combinations

  IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a JSON array of strings. Each string MUST use the exact format: "DetectiveTitle <> DetectiveTarget" with the double angle brackets (<>).

  CRITICAL: Use ONLY the <> separator, not colons or other punctuation.

  Example 1:
  Input: Video showing a crowded street with people walking normally, but one person repeatedly checking their watch and looking around nervously while carrying a large bag.

  Output: [
    "Homicide Detective <> Investigate potential criminal activity and suspicious behavior patterns",
    "Narcotics Detective <> Examine the bag contents and investigate drug-related activities",
    "Bomb Squad Technician <> Assess if the bag contains explosive devices or dangerous materials",
    "Street Crimes Detective <> Monitor for pickpocketing, theft, or other street-level crimes"
  ]

  Example 2:
  Input: Video showing a car accident scene where multiple vehicles are involved, but one driver immediately flees the scene on foot while others stay to help.

  Output: [
    "Traffic Homicide Detective <> Investigate the hit-and-run and determine if it was intentional",
    "Auto Theft Detective <> Check if the fleeing driver was operating a stolen vehicle",
    "Fugitive Apprehension Officer <> Track down the fleeing suspect using available evidence",
    "Crime Scene Investigator <> Process the accident scene for physical evidence and documentation",

  IMPORTANT: You MUST evaluate ALL categories (B1, B2, B4, B5, B6, G, A) for every video.
